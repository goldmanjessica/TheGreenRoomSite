# FinalProject
Website for Los Angeles-based stand up comedy show, The Green Room. Final project for a part time front end web development course through General Assembly.

## Overview
The Green Room is a 420 friendly stand-up show every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month at Alana's Coffee Roasters in Mar Vista. The purpose of the website is to have a single destination for people to buy tickets, learn about the show and the team, discover new comedians, and sign up for the newsletter.

## Technologies used
* Javascript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Wireframes
After a few of sketches, I built out the wires, then the hi-fidelity designs, in Figma.

## Challenges

* Finding the best solution for parallax
* Aligning the Upcoming Shows and Team sections accurately
* Adding hover effects to the images to create dimension and interest
* Changing the navigation from transparent to solid
* Finding something creative to do with jQuery, ultimately landed on a "weed fact" generator to add some humor

## Solutions

* Ultimately chose simple CSS classes to add smooth parallax effects
* Found a bootstrap class for the image hover effects
* Found a jQuery workaround to have the navigation start transparent then smoothly transition to a solid background
* Worked within bootstrap columns to create alignment on shows and team sections

## Steps for moving forward 
* Continue to adjust the alignment and styles for the weed facts section
* Insert actual Instagram API to embed the feed onto the site
*  Add an FAQ page and contact form
*  Fill out rest of the team members
